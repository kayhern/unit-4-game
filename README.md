# unit-4-game

Problem: Assigned to create a jewel game using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. The user has to click on jewels (without knowing their value) to add up to the randomly generated number.

Solution: Created a random number function to generate values and the random number. Used functions to display value increase as jewels are clicked. Created a function that detected whether or not the user's score value is over or at the value of the randomly generated number. Created a function to keep track of wins and losses.
